MIT License

`draft` `optional` `author:degenrocket`

This NIP defines how to add an MIT license to Nostr events.

### Problem

Currently, the Nostr ecosystem is growing in a very friendly environment, but once the environment will change to hostile, relays and clients can face legal responsibilities for distributing the copyright-protected content.

At the moment of writing, a user who signs a Nostr event doesn't give an explicit permission for his content to be distributed without any restriction.

### Solution

The easiest solution for this problem is to add an MIT license to each signed event in accordance with the [SPASM](https://github.com/degenrocket/spasm) specification.

Then relays and clients can check whether events have an MIT license and choose whether to display/distribute such events or not.

While adding a dedicated license field (`"license":"MIT"`) would be ideal, the easiest solution with backwards-compatibility is to add a license as a tag.

```js
tags: [
  [
    "license",
    "MIT"
  ]
]
```

### Implementation

Here is an example of adding an MIT license to each Nostr event as a tag.

```js
let nostrEvent = {
  kind: 1,
  created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  tags: [
    [
      "spasm_version",
      "1.0.0"
    ],
    [
      "spasm_target",
      "0xbd934a01dc3bd9bb183bda807d35e61accf7396c527b8a3d029c20c00b294cf029997be953772da32483b077eea856e6bafcae7a2aff95ae572af25dd3e204a71b"
    ],
    [
      "spasm_action",
      "reply"
    ],
    [
      "license",
      "MIT"
    ]
  ],
  content: "not your keys, not your words",
  pubkey: "b0635d6a9851d3aed0cd6c495b282167acf761729078d975fc341b22650b07b9",
}
```
